Per-Item Evaluation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] F-715 A and B Particulate Filters
  Resolved entity: F-715A (E1)
  Pressure: match | expected=275 | observed=[OPERATING: 230 PSIG; DESIGN: 275 PSIG]
  Temperature: match | expected=100 | observed=[DESIGN: 275 PSIG @ 100F]
  Tool calls used: 1
  Notes: [The entity F-715A matches the SOP item F-715 A and B Particulate Filters (Left unit).; Design pressure is 275 PSIG and design temperature is 100 F, which matches the expected SOP limits exactly.; ... (+2 more)]

[2] V-745 Stabilizer Tower
  Resolved entity: V-745 (V-745)
  Pressure: match | expected=300 | observed=[M.W.P.: 300 PSIG; PSV 745-151 SET AT 300 PSIG]
  Temperature: match | expected=375 | observed=[M.W.P.: 300 PSIG @ 375°F]
  Tool calls used: 1
  Notes: [V-745 is an NGL Stabilizer vessel, vertical stabilizer tower with internal trays and multiple nozzles.; Maximum working pressure (design rating) is 300 PSIG at 375°F.; ... (+1 more)]

[3] E-742 Exchanger (Shell)
  Resolved entity: E-742 Exchanger (Shell) (e2)
  Pressure: missing | expected=300 | observed=[]
  Temperature: mismatch | expected=375 | observed=[90° F]
  Tool calls used: 4
  Notes: [No direct pressure measurements found for E-742 in knowledge graph.; Observed temperature setpoint measurement is 90° F from the insulation callout context, which is much lower than SOP expected temperature of 375 F.; ... (+1 more)]

[4] E-742 Exchanger (Tube)
  Resolved entity: E-742 (e2)
  Pressure: missing | expected=300 | observed=[]
  Temperature: mismatch | expected=250 | observed=[90 °F (temperature setpoint from insulation callout '2" THK. HOT INSULATION SET @ 90° F.')]
  Tool calls used: 3
  Notes: [No direct pressure or operating temperature limits found in the KG for E-742 exchanger; only an insulation temperature setpoint of 90 °F indicated on the exchanger shell insulation. SOP expected temperature (250 °F) is significantly higher than the insulation setpoint.]

[5] AC-746 After Cooler
  Resolved entity: AC-746 (e1)
  Pressure: missing | expected=350 | observed=[]
  Temperature: mismatch | expected=-20 to 400 | observed=[SET @ 100° F]
  Tool calls used: 6
  Notes: [Entity AC-746 identified as After Cooler matching SOP item name.; No direct pressure measurement or limits observed in knowledge graph for AC-746.; ... (+2 more)]
